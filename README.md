# Dual Compiler

In this repository, we embark on an ambitious journey to develop a Dual Compiler that has the remarkable ability to process and compile both the French and Arabe (Darija) languages. This innovative program has been meticulously crafted in the C programming language, and it is a product of ground-up development.

The Dual Compiler represents a bridge between linguistic diversity, making it a versatile tool for a broad range of users. Its dual language support empowers developers and learners to work in their preferred language, whether it's French or Arabe (Darija).

With this project, we aim to enhance accessibility and usability in the world of programming and computational linguistics. By offering seamless compilation of code in two distinct languages, we open doors for individuals and organizations seeking efficient and effective ways to express and process information.

Join us on this linguistic and technological voyage as we explore the possibilities that arise when a Dual Compiler converges two vibrant languages into one powerful tool.

Your journey begins with the following steps:

## Installation

Before you can run the program, ensure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your machine. If it's not already installed, you can download and install it from the official GCC website


Next, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheSkyAboveTheSky/Dual-Compilers.git
```

Navigate to the repository's directory:
```bash
cd Dual-Compilers
```

## Usage

1. **Linux Environment:**
   - You can run the program directly in a Linux environment.

2. **Windows with Git Bash:**
   - Alternatively, you can use Git Bash in Windows to execute the program.
```bash
chmod +x compile_and_run.sh
./compile_and_run.sh
```


You will receive a prompt to select one of the two languages:
```bash
Selectionner un langage : 
1 : 1 = AR
2 : 2 = FR
```

Please input the number that corresponds to your preferred language and press Enter. You will then be given the option to select a test from a list of pre-prepared tests or choose to create your own.
